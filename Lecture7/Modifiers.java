Modifiers
By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in almost all of our examples:
*/
public class Modifiers {
    /*
    We divide modifiers into two groups:

    Access Modifiers - controls the access level
    Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level,
                           but provides other functionality
    */
