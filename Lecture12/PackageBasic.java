    Java Packages & API:
    A package in Java is used to group related classes.
    Think of it as a folder in a file directory.
    We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
        Packages are divided into two categories:
            Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
            User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
